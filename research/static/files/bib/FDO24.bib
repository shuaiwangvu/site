Despite that many FIPs were created in domains such as medicine and environmental science, few FIPs were available in social sciences. This extended abstract reports recent advances in creating and using FIPs in social sciences. It consists of a summary of available FIPs in social sciences. Three use cases were included to demonstrate how FIPs can be used to guide data management for researchers, organisations, and communities. Finally, we envision some future work on FIP development.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, journal={Open Conference Proceedings}, author={Wang, Shuai and Maineri, Angelica and Singh, Navroop K. and Hofstra, Tycho}, year={2025}, month={Mar.} }
