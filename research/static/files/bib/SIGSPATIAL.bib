abstract = {The mission of resilience of Ukrainian cities calls for international collaboration with the scientific community to increase the quality of information by identifying and integrating information from various news and social media sources. Linked Data technology can be used to unify, enrich, and integrate data from multiple sources. In our work, we focus on datasets about damaging events in Ukraine due to Russia's invasion since February 2022. We convert two selected datasets to Linked Data and enrich them with additional geospatial information. Following that, we present an algorithm for the detection of identical events from different datasets. Our pipeline makes it easy to convert and enrich datasets to integrated Linked Data. The resulting dataset consists of 10K reported events covering damage to hospitals, schools, roads, residential buildings, etc. Finally, we demonstrate in use cases how our dataset can be applied to different scenarios for resilience purposes.},
