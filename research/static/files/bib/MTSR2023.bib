abstract="FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) is a special kind of linked data that consists of questions and answers about communities' decisions about the use of resources regarding the FAIR principles. Some FIPs have been created to capture collective decisions by communities. However, FIPs have not been widely adopted by the communities in social science. In this paper, we explore how FIPs can capture the decisions of communities in social science by creating their FIPs and comparing them against existing attempts. The created FIPs could be used as a structured way of cataloging FAIR-related implementation, comparing the resources used across communities, as well as understanding the practice of FAIR principles. We perform our analysis by generating the FAIR Convergence Matrix and comparing the resources used and their use. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned and the limitations of this approach.",
